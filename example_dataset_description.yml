# DATASET DESCRIPTION FILE
#
# Here, we are describing our dataset. There are only a couple pieces
# of information that you have to supply. The first is the class names:
class_names: ["healthy", "ring", "schitzont", "troph"]
# Neural networks encode classes by integers, and the list above defines this
# ordering by index. I.e. "0" maps to "healthy", "1" maps to ring, e.t.c.
#
# You can define how the dataset is split up. This is the `dataset_split_fractions`
# definition below. It splits up the total dataset (all image-label pairs) by the
# percentages below. Each of these keys are required, and their values must sum
# to 1.
dataset_split_fractions:
  train: 0.7
  test:  0.25
  val:   0.05
#
# Finally, we have to actually point to our data. If we have just one set of
# folders for images and labels, then we just define the image path and label
# path, like below:
image_path: <path to images>
label_path: <path to labels>
# However, if we want multiple sets of folders for training and inference, we
# use `dataset_paths` to define the paths to folders individually.
dataset_paths:
  set1:  # this name is just for your convenience!
    image_path: <path to images>
    label_path: <path to labels>
  set2:
    image_path: <path to images>
    label_path: <path to labels>
  ...
